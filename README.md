FocusForge is a project I started to work on in 2026. It is a calandar/to do list app that instead of sorting by urgency, sorts your tasks by importance. We determine importance by having the user rank every new task in how important it is compared to other tasks. To make this process easier, we have the user only compare two tasks at a time and use a binary search algorithm to guide the user to placing their tasks at the right level of importance. This app was built for poeple who believe that what is important is not maximizing how much you can do in a day, but maximizing the quality of what you do.
